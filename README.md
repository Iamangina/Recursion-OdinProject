# Recursion-OdinProject

This project explores recursion through two classic computer science problems: Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort.
Both examples demonstrate how a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, the essence of recursive thinking.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two before it.
It can be generated in two ways:

  --Iterative approach: uses a loop to build the sequence step by step.

  --Recursive approach: repeatedly calls the same function, each time extending the sequence until the desired length is reached.

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an array by:

  --Dividing it into smaller halves until each subarray has one element.

  --Sorting and merging these subarrays back together in the correct order.
